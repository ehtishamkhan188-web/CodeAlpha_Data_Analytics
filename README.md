# CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship

This repository contains the tasks completed during my Data Analytics internship at **CodeAlpha**.

## Project Overview
The project focuses on performing data analysis and visualization to extract meaningful insights from raw data.

### Tasks Performed:
1. **Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Explored the Titanic dataset structure.
   - Identified missing values (e.g., 177 missing values in 'Age').
   - Analyzed statistical summaries of the data.

2. **Task 3: Data Visualization**
   - Created a **Survival Count** bar chart to show the number of survivors vs non-survivors.
   - Built a **Survival Rate by Gender** chart, highlighting that females had a higher survival rate.
   - Generated a **Correlation Heatmap** to show relationships between different variables like class, age, and survival.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Tool:** Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Download the `.ipynb` file from this repository.
2. Upload it to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Run all cells to see the analysis and visualizations.
